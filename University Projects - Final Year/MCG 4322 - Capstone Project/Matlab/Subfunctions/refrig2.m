function win=refrig2(h1, h2)
win=h1-h2; %Work done by the compressor
%Compressor heats refrigerant to condense through condenser coils
%This value is important to identify the minimum speed the compressor needs
%to run at for the refrigeration cycle
%This compressor speed then can find the time the system can run without
%any power
